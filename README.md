Here's How I implemented the model...

# Wav2Lip - Lip Sync Model Implementation

## üìå Project Overview  
This project implements **Wav2Lip**, a state-of-the-art lip-syncing model. Given an input video and an audio file, the model generates a new video where the speaker‚Äôs lips are synchronized with the provided speech.

## üöÄ Steps to Run the Project  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip.git
cd Wav2Lip
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and Activate Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv wav2lip_env
wav2lip_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source wav2lip_env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Download and Place Model Checkpoints**
- Download the **Wav2Lip checkpoint** from:  
  üíΩ [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W9mq3vAl83VVjuEv9TOpATQojcI9D7Kb)  
- Place the `.pth` file inside the `checkpoints/` folder.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Audio from Text (TTS)**
Use **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** to generate the speech audio:
```python
from gtts import gTTS

text = """Namaste Mathangi! My name is Anika, and I‚Äôm here to guide you through managing your credit 
card dues. Mathangi, as of today, your credit card bill shows an amount due of INR 5,053 which 
needs to be paid by 31st December 2024. Missing this payment could lead to two significant consequences: 
First, a late fee will be added to your outstanding balance. 
Second, your credit score will be negatively impacted, which may affect your future borrowing ability. 
Make your payment by clicking the link here... Pay through UPI or bank transfer. Thank you!"""

tts = gTTS(text, lang='en', tld='co.in')  # Indian accent
tts.save("audio.mp3")
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Convert Image to Video**
If using an **image** instead of a **video**, create a short silent video:
```bash
ffmpeg -loop 1 -i input_image.jpg -c:v libx264 -t 5 -pix_fmt yuv420p input_video.mp4
```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Run Wav2Lip for Lip Syncing**
```bash
python inference.py --checkpoint_path checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth --face input_video.mp4 --audio audio.mp3
```

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Output Location**
- The generated **lip-synced video** is saved in the `results/` folder.
